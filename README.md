# Volumetric Reconstruction from Printed Films

This is a research-focused toolkit developed within the [GIFT-Surg][giftsurg] project to reconstruct a volumetric representation from printed brain MR films as described in [Ebner et al., 2017][citation].

The algorithm and software were developed by [Michael Ebner][mebner] at the [Translational Imaging Group][tig] in the [Centre for Medical Image Computing][cmic] at [University College London (UCL)][ucl] and will be published soon.
